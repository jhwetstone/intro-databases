/*
1. What is the average length of all tracks in the Track table, in minutes? Call the column "AverageLengthInMinutes"
*/




/* 
2. What is the average length of all tracks in the Track table in minutes, by media type id? The columns returned by your query should be MediaTypeId, AverageLengthInMinutes
*/




    
/*
3. Look at the media types in the MediaType table. Do they make sense, given what you found above?
*/




/* 
4. How many rows in the Track table have "NULL" in the composer field?
*/





/*
5. HARD: What is the percentage of rows in the Track table with "NULL" in the composer field?

*/





/*

*/ 





/*
7. Calculate a histogram of number of tracks per price
*/
